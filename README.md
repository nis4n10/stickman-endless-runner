**Stickman Endless Runner** is an interactive **Python game** built using **Pygame**, where the player controls a stickman running endlessly through a scrolling environment.  

The goal is to **avoid obstacles** and survive as long as possible to achieve a high score. This project combines **custom stickman animation**, **interactive buttons**, and **endless gameplay**, making it **fun, visually appealing, and teacher-approved**.
